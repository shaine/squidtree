// Here's where we define some default constants
@import "partials/base";

// Now, you can simply include everything
// (except media) by uncommeting this line
//@include html5-boilerplate;

// Or, you can pick and choose only the sections
// you want by using the these includes
@import "html5-boilerplate/html5-boilerplate";
@include html5-boilerplate;

// Or, you can import the "overrides" partial if
// you want more control over individual mixins
//@import "partials/overrides";

// Finally, put your own styles in these partials
// and add more as needed (i.e. forms, tables, nav)
@import "partials/fonts";
@import "partials/page";

@import "blog";

// Media should come last
@import "partials/media";
